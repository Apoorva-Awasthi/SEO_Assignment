Ways to improve accessibility of HTML:

1) Add proper alt text to images:
   --> Using alt text to provide access to the content of images for individuals who cannot see them, including people using screen readers or Braille output devices. 

2) Use Headings properly:
   --> It help non-visual users (including search engines) to understand how the page is organized, and make it easy for screen reader users to navigate.

3) Add labels to form fields:
   --> Using the HTML label element so screen reader users will know which labels or prompts are associated with which form fields.
